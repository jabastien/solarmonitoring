					<strong>Green WiFi</strong><br>
					<a class="myEmail" href= http://www.green-wifi.org target="_blank"> green-wifi.org</a><br />
					Green WiFi has developed a low cost, solar-powered, standardized WiFi access solution that runs out-of-the-box with no systems integration or power requirements. 
					Green WiFi aims to complement and extend the power and promise of initiatives such as the UN/MIT One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project, Intel's World Ahead Program and other 
					NGO efforts dedicated to providing affordable computing capabilities to developing areas by providing critical last mile access; last mile internet access with nothing more 
					than a single broadband internet connection, rooftops and the sun.</p>

					<a class="myEmail" href= http://iitempoweringhaiti.org target="_blank"> iitempoweringhaiti.org</a><br />
					Our goal: To design and deploy a replicable, open source solar solution at primary schools in Haiti. We are a group of ten undergraduate students at the Illinois Institute 
					of Technology who, with the support of faculty and industry advisers, are working to improve the conditions of education in Haiti, by helping to support the implementation of 
					the One Laptop Per Child Program. Our goal is to foster collaboration between partners in the US and in Haiti and to create a sustainable energy solution that will enable 
					the children to charge their XO laptops.</p>
					<p><strong>ATLAS Institute/MS-ICTD Laboratory</strong><br />
					ATLAS is an innovative campus-wide initiative in education, research, creative work and outreach in which information and communication technology is the enabling 
					force. ATLAS programs bring together students, educators, artists, writers, scholars and leaders from the academy, industry, non-profits and government to create a 
					multidisciplinary environment that contributes to the understanding of the interaction of ICT and human society, and to the realization of the full potential of 
					that interaction. </p>
